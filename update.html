                <h2>Coronavirus Disease 2019 Basics</h2>    
                <button class="accordion">What is novel coronavirus ?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.</p>

                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Why do the number of cases for previous days increase?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p> Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase. (Sometimes this effect is described as “backfill.”) State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC. Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late.</p>

                <h2>How COVID-19 Spreads</h2>
                    
                <button class="accordion">What is the source of virus?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Can I get sick with COVID-19 if it is on food?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">What temperature kills the virus that causes COVID-19?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p> Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. </p>

                <h2>Children and Youth with Special Healthcare Needs</h2>
                    
                <button class="accordion">How can my family cope with the added stress?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations. You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your family’s situation. It is important to continue your family’s coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">What if my child or someone else in the home is sick with symptoms of COVID-19?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your child’s healthcare provider. If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911. If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">What if my child needs to go to the hospital?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p> If your child’s healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:

                    Ask the healthcare provider to let the hospital know you are coming and to share the important information the hospital will need to know to care for your child.
                    Visiting policies may have changed due to COVID-19. If your child’s hospital policy does not allow an adult to stay with a child, ask your child’s healthcare provider for a statement explaining your child’s need for a familiar adult to be present.</p>
                </div>
                    
                    
                <button class="accordion">Should I use soap and water or a hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p> Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</p>
