                                    <h3>Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of Eye Protection</h3>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>HCP and facilities—along with their healthcare coalitions, local and state health departments, and local and state partners—will have to work together to develop strategies that identify and extend PPE supplies, so that recommended PPE will be available when needed most. When using PPE optimization strategies, training on PPE use, including proper donning and doffing procedures, must be provided to HCP before they carry out patient care activities.</p><br/>
                                    <p>Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of eye protection during the COVID-19 response. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve eye protection supplies along the continuum of care.</p>

			<h1>Medications</h1>
            <p>It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity.45 ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter into the host cell. There are no data to suggest a link between ACE inhibitors or ARBs with worse COVID-19 outcomes. The American Heart Association (AHA), the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) released a statement recommending continuation of these drugs for patients already receiving them for heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease.46

            It has also been hypothesized that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may worsen COVID-19. Currently, there are no data suggesting an association between COVID-19 clinical outcomes and NSAID use.
